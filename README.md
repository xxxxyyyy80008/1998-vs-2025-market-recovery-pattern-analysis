##  OVERVIEW

### Objective
Comprehensive comparison of market recovery patterns between the **1998 Crisis** and **2025 Market Drop**, analyzing whether historical patterns can predict future recovery trajectories through detailed technical and statistical analysis.

### Comparison Periods
- **Historical Benchmark**: 1998-1999 Crisis Recovery (24 months)
- **Current Analysis**: 2025-2026 Market Drop Recovery (actual data + projections)

### Key Crisis Dates
- **1998 Crisis Trough**: October 8, 1998
- **2025 Crisis Trough**: April 8, 2025
- **Analysis Window**: 24 months (504 trading days) post-crisis
- **Pre-Crisis Context**: 57 trading days included for trend analysis

---

##  ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK

### Data Processing Methodology

#### 1. **Date Alignment Strategy**
- Both periods aligned to start at the same calendar date
- Crisis points synchronized for direct visual comparison
- 1998 timeline used as reference baseline
- 2025 dates shifted to overlay on 1998 timeline

#### 2. **Data Padding & Projection**
When 2025 data is incomplete:
- Historical pattern extrapolation using 1998 recovery trajectory
- Scaling factor applied to match current 2025 price levels
- Clear distinction between actual and projected data
- Projected period shaded/marked in visualizations

#### 3. **Normalization Methods**
- **Percentage Change**: All prices normalized to crisis point (0% reference)
- **Index-based**: First trading day = 100
- **Calendar Alignment**: Date offsets calculated for temporal comparison

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES & LIMITATIONS

### Data Considerations

#### **Historical Data Accuracy**
- Data sourced from Yahoo Finance (^GSPC)
- Adjusted for splits and dividends
- Pre-market and after-hours data excluded
- Timezone normalized to UTC

#### **Projection Limitations**
- **Assumption**: 2025 follows 1998 pattern
- **Reality**: Each crisis is unique with different:
  - Economic fundamentals
  - Market structure
  - Policy responses
  - Global conditions
- **Use Case**: Scenario analysis, not prediction
- **Disclaimer**: Past performance ≠ future results

### Analytical Constraints

#### **Data Availability**
- 2025 analysis depends on available historical data at time of execution
- Insufficient data (< 20 days) limits moving average calculations
- Volatility metrics require minimum window size
- Statistical significance improves with longer timeframes

#### **Alignment Methodology**
- Calendar date alignment may not capture seasonal effects
- Trading day counts may vary due to holidays
- Different market microstructure (1998 vs 2025)
- Technology and trading algorithm differences

#### **Projection Method**
- Simple pattern replication, not econometric modeling
- No consideration of fundamental differences
- Scaling assumes linear relationship
- No regime change modeling

### Usage Recommendations

#### **For Investment Decisions**
- ⚠️ Use as one input among many
- Combine with fundamental analysis
- Consider current economic conditions
- Consult financial advisor
- Understand your risk tolerance

#### **For Research & Analysis**
- ✓ Pattern recognition and comparison
- ✓ Historical context understanding
- ✓ Risk-reward scenario modeling
- ✓ Volatility regime analysis
- ✓ Educational purposes

#### **Not Suitable For**
- ❌ Sole basis for investment decisions
- ❌ Short-term trading signals
